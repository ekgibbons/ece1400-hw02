# ECE 1400 HW 2

Q:  Describe in a paragraph or so the considerations you used in designing your test data. If your code works properly for your test data, will it always work correctly for other datasets?

Q:  Should you expect an exact 15% / 75% / 10% distribution for the reads that align zero, one, and two times? What other factors will affect the exact distribution of the reads?

Q:  How much time did you spend writing the code for this part? Keeping track of the time you spend on coding is also a useful habit. Depending on your career path, in the future you may have to keep track of time for billing purposes or be asked to scope projects and estimate the hours required to complete them. The amount of time spent will not affect your grade. gathering this information to help gauge the difficulty level of the assignment. If youâ€™ve spent over 5 hours on the assignment and have not made very substantial progress towards finishing it you should come to office hours to discuss your approach and implementation progress.

Q:  Does the distribution of reads that align zero, one, and two or more times exactly match the distributions you computed as you were creating the datasets? Why or why not?

Q:  Using your timing results what can you say about the scalability of your implementation as the size of the reference varies? Estimate the time to align the data for a human at 30x coverage and a read length of 50. Is it feasible to actually do this using your program?

Q:  How much time did you spend writing the code for this part?
